# Krypton Client
This is a fork of the original Krypton, I'm adding features such as Fullbright and Nofall (basically making it a functional client instead of an expensive skidded client for 12-yearolds).

I fixed AutoInvTotem, as it was not working.

Changelog:
- Fixed AutoInvTotem
- Added Fullbright
- Added NoFall
- Added Flight (including AntiKick from TrouserStreak)
- Added a slider for crystal speed in Auto Crystal
- Added Anti Consume for fireworks
